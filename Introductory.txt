One man Fugu is another's man's poison. 
Fugu is the Japanese word for pufferfish and the dish prepared from it, normally species of genus Takifugu, Lagocephalus, or 
Sphoeroides, or porcupinefish of the genus Diodon. In Korean, it is called bogeo (복어) or bok (복). Fugu can be lethally poisonous
 due to its tetrodotoxin; therefore, it must be carefully prepared to remove toxic parts and to avoid contaminating the meat.
