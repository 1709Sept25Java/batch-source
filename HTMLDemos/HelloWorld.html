Let's make a happy little mountain now. This is the fun part It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death.
Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Let's have a happy little tree in here. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Now then, let's play.
You're meant to have fun in life. In your world you can create anything you desire. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper.
I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. This is unplanned it really just happens.</p>
